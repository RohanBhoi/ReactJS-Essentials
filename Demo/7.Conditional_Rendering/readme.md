*** Conditional Rendering ***     

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
-- For example : Refer Demo-01

* Element Variables:
You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change.
-- For example : Refer Demo-02

* Preventing Component from Rendering :
In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output.
